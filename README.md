Description

The semantics and accessibility of a webpage are very important for those that need to use a screen reader to use a webpage. The behind the scenes work of this assignment really help to understand how the accessibility and semantic structure of a site works.

Changes made to improve accessibility:

Improved semantics of HTML elements:
Changed all <div> elements to a more semantic element (section, article, aside, etc.) to fit the content.
Ensured that elements followed a logical semantic HTML structure
Ensured that all <img> elements have accessible alt attributes
Ensured all links work as expected
Organized and consolitdated CSS selectors to follow semantic structure
